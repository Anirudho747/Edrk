            "Answer: The terms \"Agentic AI\" and \"AI Agents\" are closely related and often used interchangeably, but there's a subtle distinction:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **AI Agent:** This is a broader term referring to any software or system capable of acting autonomously in an environment to achieve a specific goal.  An AI agent perceives its environment through sensors, processes this information, and acts upon it through actuators. This could be a simple rule-based system, or a sophisticated deep learning model.  Examples include a spam filter (detecting spam and filtering it), a recommendation system (suggesting products based on user data), or a game-playing bot (choosing actions to win a game).  They are goal-oriented but don't necessarily possess the full characteristics of agency.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Agentic AI:** This term emphasizes the *agency* of the AI, highlighting its ability to act autonomously and make decisions with a degree of self-determination.  It implies a higher level of autonomy, proactivity, and potentially even goal-setting beyond its initial programming.  Agentic AI goes beyond simply reacting to stimuli; it can plan, reason, learn, and adapt its behavior in pursuit of its goals.  It's a more advanced form of AI agent, closer to the human concept of agency.  A self-driving car navigating complex traffic situations, a robot collaborating with humans in a factory, or a virtual assistant that proactively anticipates your needs could all be considered examples of Agentic AI.\n",
            "\n",
            "In essence: all Agentic AI is an AI Agent, but not all AI Agents are Agentic AI.  The difference lies in the degree of autonomy and proactivity exhibited.  A simple AI agent might follow pre-programmed rules, whereas an Agentic AI demonstrates more sophisticated decision-making and self-directed behavior.  The line between the two can be blurry, and the terminology isn't always strictly defined, leading to some overlap in usage.\n",
