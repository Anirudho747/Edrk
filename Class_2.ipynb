            "Answer: While the terms \"Agentic AI\" and \"AI Agents\" are closely related and often used interchangeably, there's a subtle but important distinction:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **AI Agent:** This is a broader term encompassing any software or system that acts autonomously in an environment to achieve a goal.  An AI agent perceives its environment through sensors (input), processes that information, and acts upon it through actuators (output).  This encompasses a wide range of systems, from simple rule-based bots to complex learning agents.  The key is *autonomy* â€“ they act on their own without constant human intervention.  Examples include: a thermostat (simple), a chess-playing program (more complex), or a recommendation system (data-driven).\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Agentic AI:** This is a more specific and often stronger connotation. It emphasizes the *proactive* and *goal-directed* nature of the AI agent.  Agentic AI suggests an agent that isn't just reacting to its environment but actively shaping and influencing it to achieve its goals.  It implies a higher level of autonomy, intelligence, and potentially even a degree of self-preservation or self-interest.  Agentic AI often suggests capabilities like planning, learning, and adaptation far beyond simple reactive systems.  Examples might include a robot navigating a complex environment, a self-driving car making decisions in unpredictable traffic, or an AI managing a complex system like a power grid.\n",
            "\n",
            "In essence:\n",
            "\n",
            "* All Agentic AI is AI Agents, but not all AI Agents are Agentic AI.\n",
            "\n",
            "A simple spam filter is an AI agent because it autonomously sorts emails.  However, it's not considered *Agentic AI* because it lacks the proactive, goal-directed behavior that implies shaping its environment.  A self-driving car, on the other hand, is both an AI agent and exemplifies Agentic AI because it actively navigates the environment to reach its destination, adapting to unexpected circumstances.\n",
            "\n",
            "The distinction often lies in the level of autonomy, proactivity, and the complexity of the goals the AI is pursuing. The term \"Agentic AI\" highlights the more advanced and potentially more consequential capabilities of certain AI agents.\n",

            "3. **List medications:**  The patient should bring a list of all medications they are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.\n",
