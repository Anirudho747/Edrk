Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the elements and find more robust and stable locators.  Prioritize the locator strategies mentioned in the requirements.\n",

Completing the entire booking process requires significantly more code to handle form filling, potentially handling dynamic elements, and dealing with potentially complex interactions  (such as handling redirects, pop-ups, CAPTCHAs, etc.)  It is greatly simplified here to meet the brief.\n",
